Beat Genetics 1.0

Welcome, to get started create a new BeatGenetics class.
Pass in folder paths for the samples to use (use the ones provided or your own).
Beat Genetics is an interactive genetic algorithm system that tailors beats to user's taste. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is dependent on the amount of time
the user listens to a beat. The longer a beat is listened to, the higher its fitness score, and therefore the more likely it will survive and become a candidate in the mating pool.

With a population size of six, it creates six
randomly generated beat sequences per instrument.
Instruments Include:
kick, snare, closed hi hat, ride, tom, clap, percussion 1 & 2.

Notes:

* Focusing on one particular beat, will cause convergence. Having very similar beats is sought after sometimes however to avoid this, make sure to listen longer to varying beats.
