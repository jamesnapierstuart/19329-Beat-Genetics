19329-Beat-Genetics
===================
Beat Genetics is a genetic orientated system that generates and evolves drum beat sequences based upon the subjective aesthetic evaluation of the user. To realise this project, an interactive genetic algorithm was implemented whose fitness function was determined by the amount of time a user spends listening to a particular beat. The longer a beat is listened to, the greater fitness score it receives.
